      Students critically examine relationships between gender and work by investigating occupational aspirations, participation and attainment in education and training courses, qualifications attained, employment by occupation and/or industry and unpaid work. Students reflect on the role that gender and stereotyping can play in the choices that people make in relation to work and careers. They identify the barriers and challenges this presents for informed career and life decision-making and planning. Students identify and assess existing support structures, including relevant legislation and associated agencies. They recognise and develop the dispositions, attitudes and behaviours that support males and females pursuing non-traditional educational and career pathways. Students analyse future needs regarding support structures.<br/>Education Level: 10<br/>Subject: W",1,,,,0,null,e228bec2-1851-440c-a85a-e2477a31a09c,12951,,
