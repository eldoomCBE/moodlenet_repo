,D2454348,"Next Generation Science Standards","The Next Generation Science Standards identify content and science and engineering practices that all students should learn from kindergarten to high school graduation. To reap the benefits of the science standards, states should adopt them in whole, without alteration. Adoption of the standards is only the first step toward improving educational opportunities for all students. For states that adopt the standards, they will need to be implemented in every classroom. As the standards will not define a curriculum, states and local districts will have the responsibility for providing more detailed guidance to classroom teachers, and will have room to fill in specific content to help students learn the key ideas in the standards.<br/>Subject: science",1,"Not yet competent,Competent","[{""scaleid"":""18""},{""id"":2,""scaledefault"":1,""proficient"":1}]",,,,,,1,"competency,competency,competency,competency"
