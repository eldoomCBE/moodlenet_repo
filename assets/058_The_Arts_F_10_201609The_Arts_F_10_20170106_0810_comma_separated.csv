They explore the arts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and of the Asia region and learn that they are used for different purposes. While the arts in the local community should be the initial focus for learning, students are also aware of and interested in the arts from more distant locations and the curriculum provides opportunities to build on this curiosity.
As they make and respond to artworks, students explore meaning and interpretation, elements and forms, and social and cultural contexts of the arts. They make personal evaluations of their own and others&rsquo; artworks, making connections between their own artistic intentions and those of other artists.
Students continue to learn about safe practices in the arts and in their interactions with other artists. Their understanding of the role of the artist and the audience builds on their experience from the previous band. As an audience, students focus their attention on the artwork and respond to it.

        shapes – for example, angular, twisted, curved, straight, closed circular 
        dimension – for example, big, small 
        personal (kinesphere) and general space – for example, moving within the space around the body; extending as far as the body and body parts can reach without travelling; sharing the general dance space with other students
        pathways – for example, tracing patterns in the air with the arms, or on the floor by moving the body around, under, over
