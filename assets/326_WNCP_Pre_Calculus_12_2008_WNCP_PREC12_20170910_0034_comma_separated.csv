,WNCP--PREC12,"WNCP Pre-Calculus 12 (2008)","<p>The Western Canadian Protocol (WCP) for Collaboration in Basic Education Kindergarten to Grade 12 was signed in December 1993 by the Ministers of Education from Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan and Yukon Territory. In February 2000, following the addition of Nunavut, the protocol was renamed the Western and Northern Canadian Protocol (WNCP) for Collaboration in Basic Education (Kindergarten to Grade 12).</p><p>This pathway is designed to provide students with the mathematical understandings and critical-thinking skills identified for entry into post-secondary programs that require the study of theoretical calculus. Topics include binomial theorem, combinations, permutations relations and functions and trigonometry . The seven mathematical process (communication, connections, mental mathematics and estimation, problem solving, technology and visualization) are interwoven throughout the mathematical topics.<br /></p><p>The Common Curriculum Framework for Grades 10–12 Mathematics: Western and Northern Canadian Protocol was developed by the seven ministries of education in collaboration with teachers, administrators, parents, business representatives, post-secondary educators and others. The framework identifies beliefs about mathematics learning and teaching, general and specific outcomes, and achievement indicators agreed upon by the seven jurisdictions.</p>

WNCP--M,WNCP--M[PS],"Problem Solving [PS] ","<p>Problem solving is one of the key processes and
foundations within the field of mathematics.
Learning through problem solving should be the
focus of mathematics at all grade levels. Students
develop a true understanding of mathematical
concepts and procedures when they solve problems
in meaningful contexts. Problem solving is to be
employed throughout all of mathematics and should
be embedded throughout all the topics.</p><p>When students encounter new situations and
respond to questions of the type, <i>How would you ...?</i>
or <i>How could you ...?</i>, the problem-solving
approach is being modelled. Students develop their
own problem-solving strategies by listening to,
discussing and trying different strategies.<br /></p><p>In order for an activity to be problem-solving based,
it must ask students to determine a way to get from
what is known to what is sought. If students have
already been given ways to solve the problem, it is
not a problem, but practice. Students should not
know the answer immediately. A true problem
requires students to use prior learnings in new ways
and contexts. Problem solving requires and builds
depth of conceptual understanding and student
engagement. Students will be engaged if the
problems relate to their lives, cultures, interests,
families or current events.<br /></p><p>Both conceptual understanding and student
engagement are fundamental in moulding students’
willingness to persevere in future problem-solving
tasks.<br /></p><p>Problems are not just simple computations embedded in a
story, nor are they contrived. They are tasks that are rich
and open-ended, so there may be more than one way of
arriving at a solution or there may be multiple answers.
Good problems should allow for every student in the class
to demonstrate their knowledge, skill or understanding.
Problem solving can vary from being an individual
activity to a class (or beyond) undertaking. </p><p>In a mathematics class, there are two distinct types of
problem solving: solving contextual problems outside of
mathematics and solving mathematical problems. Finding
the maximum profit given manufacturing constraints is an
example of a contextual problem, while seeking and
developing a general formula to solve a quadratic equation
is an example of a mathematical problem. </p><p>Problem solving can also be considered in terms of
engaging students in both inductive and deductive
reasoning strategies. As students make sense of the
problem, they will be creating conjectures and looking for
patterns that they may be able to generalize. This part of
the problem-solving process often involves inductive
reasoning. As students use approaches to solving the
problem they often move into mathematical reasoning that
is deductive in nature. It is crucial that students be
encouraged to engage in both types of reasoning and be
given the opportunity to consider the approaches and
strategies used by others in solving similar problems. </p><p>Problem solving is a powerful teaching tool that fosters
multiple, creative and innovative solutions. Creating an
environment where students openly look for, and engage
in, finding a variety of strategies for solving problems
empowers students to explore alternatives and develops
confident, cognitive mathematical risk-takers.<br /></p>",1,,,,0,null,"PREC12-A3,PREC12-A4,PREC12-A5,PREC12-B10,PREC12-C1,PREC12-C2,PREC12-C3",1464,,
