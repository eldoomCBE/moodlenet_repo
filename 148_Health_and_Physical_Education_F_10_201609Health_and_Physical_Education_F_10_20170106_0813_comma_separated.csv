They do this as they examine the nature of their relationships and other factors that influence people&rsquo;s beliefs, attitudes, opportunities, decisions, behaviours and actions. Students demonstrate a range of help-seeking strategies that support them to access and evaluate health and physical activity information and services.
The curriculum for Years 7 and 8 supports students to refine a range of specialised knowledge, understanding and skills in relation to their health, safety, wellbeing, and movement competence and confidence. Students develop specialised movement skills and understanding in a range of physical activity settings. They analyse how body control and coordination influence movement composition and performance and learn to transfer movement skills and concepts to a variety of physical activities. Students explore the role that games and sports, outdoor recreation, lifelong physical activities, and rhythmic and expressive movement activities play in shaping cultures and identities. They reflect on and refine personal and social skills as they participate in a range of physical activities.

They also experience different roles that contribute to successful participation in physical activity, and propose strategies to support the development of preventive health practices that build and optimise community health and wellbeing.
In Years 9 and 10, students learn to apply more specialised movement skills and complex movement strategies and concepts in different movement environments. They also explore movement concepts and strategies to evaluate and refine their own and others&rsquo; movement performances. Students analyse how participation in physical activity and sport influence an individual&rsquo;s identities, and explore the role participation plays in shaping cultures. The curriculum also provides opportunities for students to refine and consolidate personal and social skills in demonstrating leadership, teamwork and collaboration in a range of physical activities.

They identify and describe the different emotions people experience. They identify actions that help them be healthy, safe and physically active. They identify different settings where they can be active and demonstrate how to move and play safely. They describe how their body responds to movement.
Students use personal and social skills when working with others in a range of activities. They demonstrate, with guidance, practices and protective behaviours to keep themselves safe and healthy in different activities.

The content enables students to explore their own sense of self and the factors that contribute to and influence their identities. Students learn about emotions, how to enhance their interactions with others, and the physical and social changes they go through as they grow older.
The content explores health messages and how they relate to health decisions and behaviours, and examines strategies students can use when they need help. The content also provides opportunities for students to learn through movement. It supports them in broadening the range and complexity of fundamental movement skills they are able to perform. They learn how to select, transfer and apply simple movement skills and sequences individually, in groups and in teams.
Students also further develop their knowledge, understanding and skills in relation to movement by exploring simple rule systems and safe use of equipment in a variety of physical activities and games. Through active participation, they investigate the body&rsquo;s response to different types of physical activities. In addition, students develop personal and social skills such as cooperation, decision-making, problem-solving and persistence through movement settings.

In these years, students begin to explore personal and social factors that support and contribute to their identities and emotional responses in varying situations. They also develop a further understanding of how their bodies grow and change as they get older.
The content explores knowledge, understanding and skills that supports students to build and maintain respectful relationships, make health-enhancing and safe decisions, and interpret health messages from different sources to take action to enhance their own health and wellbeing.
The curriculum in Years 3 and 4 builds on previous learning in movement to help students develop greater proficiency across the range of fundamental movement skills. Students combine movements to create more complicated movement patterns and sequences. Through participation in a variety of physical activities, students further develop their knowledge about movement and how the body moves. They do this as they explore the features of activities that meet their needs and interests and learn about the benefits of regular physical activity.
The Year 3 and 4 curriculum also gives students opportunities to develop through movement personal and social skills such as leadership, communication, collaboration, problem-solving, persistence and decision-making.

Students develop skills to manage their emotions, understand the physical and social changes that are occurring for them and examine how the nature of their relationships changes over time.
The content provides opportunities for students to contribute to building a positive school environment that supports healthy, safe and active choices for everyone. Students also explore a range of factors and behaviours that can influence health, safety and wellbeing.
Students refine and further develop a wide range of fundamental movement skills in more complex movement patterns and situations. They also apply their understanding of movement strategies and concepts when composing and creating movement sequences and participating in games and sport. Students in Years 5 and 6 further develop their understanding about movement as they learn to monitor how their body responds to different types of physical activity. In addition, they continue to learn to apply rules fairly and behave ethically when participating in different physical activities. Students also learn to effectively communicate and problem-solve in teams or groups in movement settings.
Focus areas to be addressed in Years 5 and 6 include:

alcohol and other drugs (AD)
food and nutrition (FN)
health benefits of physical activity (HBPA)
mental health and wellbeing (MH)
